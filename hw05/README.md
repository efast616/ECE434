after running build kernel the first time the bone no longer boots from the SD card

Project Idea
Connor and I are planning on building a tank that can potentially be conrolled by a phone app

1. Target = app.o
2. Dependency = app.c
3. Command = gcc

Installing Kernel

I installed the kernel using the ./build_kernel.sh command 
I have kernel version 4.18.20
